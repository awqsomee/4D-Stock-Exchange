# Exchange web application "Stonks"

## Project specification

A web application representing a full-fledged exchange. On the main page there is a list of stocks with the current price and constant updates. Also on the main page there is a search for stocks. The user can enter the name of the action he is interested in and it will be displayed on the page. For each stock, you can see a graph of changes in value. The user can register and log into the account. After that, sections such as a wallet, with the ability to track the history of changes, and a portfolio with user investments will become available. Processes such as wallet replenishment, currency conversion, buying and selling shares will also become available. If necessary, the user can log out of the account.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
